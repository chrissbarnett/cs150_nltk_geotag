Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with agony. His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow, and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/command.html?width=400&height=300">commanded his countenance</a> and tones, and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage, as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</p></li><li><p><a name="p02" id="p02"> </a>His tale is connected, and told with an <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/appear.html?width=400&height=300">appearance of the simplest truth</a>; yet I own to you that <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/letters.html?width=400&height=300">the letters of Felix and Safie</a>, which he shewed me, and the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/monster2.html?width=400&height=300">apparition of the monster</a>, seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has then really existence; I cannot doubt it; yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation; but on this point he was impenetrable.</p></li><li><p><a name="p03" id="p03"> </a>"<a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/mad2.html?width=400&height=300">Are you mad</a>, my friend?" said he, "or whither does your <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/curios.html?width=400&height=300">senseless curiosity</a> lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the world a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/enemy.html?width=400&height=300">demoniacal enemy</a>? Or to what do your questions tend? Peace, peace! learn my miseries, and do not seek to increase your own."</p></li><li><p><a name="p04" id="p04"> </a><a id="fwal02" name="fwal02"> </a>Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history: he asked to see them, and then himself <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/correct.html?width=400&height=300">corrected and augmented</a> them in many places; but principally <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/giving.html?width=400&height=300">in giving the life and spirit</a> to the conversations he held with his enemy. "Since you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/mutilate.html?width=400&height=300">mutilated one</a> should go down to posterity."</p></li><li><p><a name="p05" id="p05"> </a>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/imagin.html?width=400&height=300">the strangest tale that ever imagination formed</a>. My thoughts, and every feeling of my soul, have been drunk up by the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/interest.html?width=400&height=300">interest for my guest</a>, which this tale, and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him; yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered feelings to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/offspring.html?width=400&height=300">offspring of solitude and delirium</a>: he believes, that, when in dreams he holds converse with his friends, and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries, or <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/excite.html?width=400&height=300">excitements to his vengeance</a>, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the real beings who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/almostas.html?width=400&height=300">almost as imposing and interesting as truth</a>.</p></li><li><p><a name="p06" id="p06"> </a>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge, and a quick and piercing apprehension. His <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/eloquenc.html?width=400&height=300">eloquence</a> is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident, or <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/endeav.html?width=400&height=300">endeavours to move the passions</a> of pity or love, without tears. What <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/glorious.html?width=400&height=300">a glorious creature</a> must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin. He seems to feel his own worth, and the greatness of his fall.</p></li><li><p><a name="p07" id="p07"> </a><a id="fwal03" name="fwal03"> </a>"When younger," said he, "I felt as if I were <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/destined.html?width=400&height=300">destined</a> for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound; but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me, when others would have been oppressed; for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow-creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/projector.html?width=400&height=300">the herd of common projectors</a>. But this feeling, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing; and, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/archangl.html?width=400&height=300">like the archangel</a> who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell. My <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/imaginat.html?width=400&height=300">imagination</a> was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea, and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect, without passion, my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! my friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.

They entered; and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me, to make me a demand, which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice, and should probably never escape; but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate, and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage, and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.

Yet <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/fellow.html?width=400&height=300">I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery</a>. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/virtue.html?width=400&height=300">the love of virtue</a>, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/particip.html?width=400&height=300">I wished to be participated</a>. But now, that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer alone, while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I am well <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/memory.html?width=400&height=300">satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory</a>. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of bringing forth. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now vice has degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No crime, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I call over the frightful catalogue of my deeds, I cannot believe that I am he whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/alone.html?width=400&height=300">I am quite alone</a>.</p></li><li><p><a name="p43" id="p43"> </a>"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes. But, in the detail which he gave you of them, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured, wasting in impotent passions. For whilst I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires. <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/ardcrave.html?width=400&height=300">They were for ever ardent and craving</a>; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/recollec.html?width=400&height=300">the recollection of this injustice</a>.</p></li><li><p><a name="p44" id="p44"> </a><a id="fwal16" name="fwal16"> </a>"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me; but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when they will meet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts, no more.</p></li><li><p><a name="p45" id="p45"> </a>"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is nearly complete. Neither your's nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being, and accomplish that which must be done; but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which brought me hither, and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/northern.html?width=400&height=300">I shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe</a>; I shall collect my funeral pile, and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel the winds play on my cheeks. <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/light.html?width=400&height=300">Light, feeling, and sense</a>, will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the first images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the chirping of the birds, and these were all to me, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/wept.html?width=400&height=300">I should have wept to die</a>; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by crimes, and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?</p></li><li><p><a name="p46" id="p46"> </a><a id="fwal17" name="fwal17"> </a>"Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive, and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hast not yet ceased to think and feel, thou desirest not my life for my own misery. Blasted as thou wert, <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/agony.html?width=400&height=300">my agony was still superior to thine</a>; for the bitter sting of remorse may not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.</p></li><li><p><a name="p47" id="p47"> </a>"But soon," he cried, with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit will sleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. Farewell."</p></li><li><p><a name="p48" id="p48"> </a> He sprung from the cabin-window, as he said this, upon the ice-raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves, and <a class="colorbox-node" href="/editions/frankenstein/V3notes/lost.html?width=400&height=300">lost in darkness and distance</a>."</p></li></ol><p style="text-align: center" class="desc">&lt; <a href="/editions/frankenstein/1818v3/ch7.html">Chapter 7</a></p></div></div></div>    </div>
