<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195" />I have been requested to speak of the history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the present century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196" />An old writer once said, <q direct="unspecified">Happy are the people who have no history.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197" />This is only another mode of expressing the quiet happiness of the calm, contented life in which so many of our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns moved on, with little to record and little to disturb them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198" />Not being a native of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and not yet a centenarian, I can hardly be expected to have any personal recollection of the early portion of the half-century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199" />My sources of information are the same that are accessible to most of you, the town records, the history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> so carefully prepared by <persName n="Brooks,Reverend,Charles,,," id="n0334.0022.00082.01022" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,," authname="brooks,charles"><roleName n="Reverend" full="yes">Rev.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Charles</foreName> <surname full="yes">Brooks</surname></persName>, and the traditions and recollections of the few survivors of that early time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200" />Alas, they are but few!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201" />Of the few with whom I became acquainted on my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, more than <measure n="65years" type="date">sixty-five years</measure> ago, not <num value="1">one</num> survives; and of those whom I knew when I became a permanent resident in <dateStruct value="1843--" full="yes" authname="1843"><year reg="1843" full="yes">1843</year></dateStruct>, scarcely <num value="1">one</num> remains, and some entire families have disappeared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202" />There were really but <num value="2">two</num> events of importance which marked the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203" />The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the war of <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204" />At that time Dr. (afterwards Governor) <placeName key="tgn,2423378" n="1.000 1" reg="john brook, windham, connecticut" authname="tgn,2423378">John Brooks</placeName>, a native of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, had at the conclusion of the <name>Revolutionary</name> war returned to the home of his childhood and resumed the practice of his profession, living in the old house which was taken down a few years ago and replaced by the building of the <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">Savings Bank</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205" />His <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> son, <placeName key="tgn,2423378" n="1.000 1" reg="john brook, windham, connecticut" authname="tgn,2423378">John Brooks</placeName>, adopted his father's profession, but on the outbreak of the war joined the army, with the rank of lieutenant, and fell on shipboard in the great naval battle of <placeName reg="Lake City, Columbia, Florida" key="tgn,2020038" authname="tgn,2020038">Lake</placeName> <pb id="p.83" n="83" /> <placeName key="tgn,1014775" n="1.000 1" reg="fort erie,ontario,canada,north and central america" authname="tgn,1014775">Erie</placeName>, which gave to our fleet the control of the lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206" />In this war <num value="18">eighteen</num> <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> citizens enlisted, <num value="2">two</num> of whom, <persName n="Gates,,Edmund,,," id="n0334.0022.00083.01023" reg="default:Gates,Edmund,,," authname="gates,edmund"><foreName full="yes">Edmund</foreName> <surname full="yes">Gates</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shed,,Abiel,R.,," id="n0334.0022.00083.01024" reg="default:Shed,Abiel,R.,," authname="shed,abiel,r."><foreName full="yes">Abiel</foreName> <foreName full="yes">R.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Shed</surname></persName>, were killed in battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208" />But the <name>Embargo</name> of <dateStruct value="1808--" full="yes" authname="1808"><year reg="1808" full="yes">1808</year></dateStruct>, so destructive to the mercantile prosperity of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, closed that career for a time, but it was renewed soon after, and he returned to his chosen profession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209" />But when the war broke out he received a commission as captain in the army, and remained and did good service in the army as long as he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210" />He was brevetted major for gallant conduct at the battle of <placeName reg="Plattsburgh, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,7016176" authname="tgn,7016176">Plattsburg</placeName>, and afterwards received a commission as lieutenant-colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211" />He once told me a little incident of his experience during the war. A company of sailors had been drafted for service in the fleet on the lakes, and were to march under his command from the <name>North End</name> of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445" authname="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to go into camp at <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002" authname="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212" />They marched through <placeName reg="Hanover, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049868" authname="tgn,2049868">Hanover</placeName> and down Court streets, and on reaching <address><street n="Washington street">Washington street</street></address> he gave the order, <q direct="unspecified">Right wheel.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213" />Whether as sailors they did not understand the order, or the strong breeze coming up State street with its familiar smell of the sea attracted them, the order shouted out with all his strength was disregarded, and they continued to head straight for <placeName reg="Long wharf">Long wharf</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214" />His old instincts as a sailor prompted him, and with a yell as from a speaking-trumpet came the order, <q direct="unspecified">Luff, d—n you, luff!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215" />This they understood, and coming up handsomely into the wind's eye took the road for <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002" authname="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216" />The incident was a source of amusement in the papers at the time, and caricatures of it were printed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217" /><persName n="Brooks,Colonel,,,," id="n0334.0022.00083.01027" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Alexander,Scammell,," authname="brooks,alexander,scammell"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Colonel</roleName> <surname full="yes">Brooks</surname></persName>, though stationed from time to time <pb id="p.84" n="84" /> in various parts of the country with his command, made <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> his home when permitted, as long as he lived, occupying the old house of his father before mentioned, where in the old time I had many a game of whist with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218" />His fate was a singular <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219" />He had always a great horror of steamboats, and would never voluntarily travel on <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220" />But in <dateStruct value="1836-12-" full="yes" authname="1836-12"><month reg="12" full="yes">December</month>, <year reg="1836" full="yes">1836</year></dateStruct>, he was ordered to proceed from <placeName reg="Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2335409" authname="tgn,2335409">Fort Moultrie, S. C.</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240" authname="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, to take command of his regiment in the <rs>Florida</rs> war. He embarked on the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Dolphin;</rs> the boilers, as he had always anticipated, blew up, and he was killed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221" />In the early part of the century all male citizens between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num> were compelled to do military duty, unless excused by physical disability or by the holding of certain offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222" />They formed the militia of the <rs>State</rs>, and were usually called out <num value="3">three</num> times a year: in the spring for inspection of arms and equipments, the absence of which, as well as non-appearance, was punished by a fine; again, in the summer, for drill; and in the autumn by regiments or brigades, at what was called general muster, for review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223" />This last was a great occasion, in which all the high officials of the military, with their glittering uniforms, and frequently the governor, paraded in all their glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224" />The plain in the easterly part of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, now covered with streets and houses, was frequently the muster-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225" />Such a company existed in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> as early as <dateStruct value="1781--" full="yes" authname="1781"><year reg="1781" full="yes">1781</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226" />Until <dateStruct value="1804--" full="yes" authname="1804"><year reg="1804" full="yes">1804</year></dateStruct> this company belonged to the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First Brigade</orgName>, and <orgName type="division" n="Division 3">Third Division</orgName>; then a new regiment was formed, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, and the company was transferred to it, and from that time I believe that every company formed in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, with possibly the exception of <num value="1">one</num> of those raised during the war, has formed a part of the same <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">Fifth Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227" />I would also except the <orgName type="mil" key="IndependentCompany">Independent Company</orgName> organized under the same law of <dateStruct value="1785--" full="yes" authname="1785"><year reg="1785" full="yes">1785</year></dateStruct>, and <pb id="p.85" n="85" /> with the same standing and liberties as the <rs>Boston</rs> and the <rs>Salem Cadets</rs>, belonging to no regiment and having the right of the line at reviews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228" />This company resigned its charter in <dateStruct value="1828--" full="yes" authname="1828"><year reg="1828" full="yes">1828</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229" />You all know the little brick powder-house standing near the top of the hill, just above the house of <persName n="Sise,Mister,A.,F.,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01028" reg="default:Sise,A.,F.,," authname="sise,a.,f."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">A.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">F.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Sise</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230" />Within my recollection it was used for the storage of powder and was protected by a lightning-rod.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231" />During the war of <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct> the company last mentioned kept guard over it for some weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232" />Upon the dissolution of this company the members were, under the existing law, enrolled in the militia company under the command of <persName n="Sparrell,Captain,John,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01029" reg="default:Sparrell,John,,," authname="sparrell,john"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Sparrell</surname></persName>, whom some of my elder hearers may remember, and who appeared at the muster that autumn at the head of a company of <num value="196">one hundred and ninety-six</num> rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233" /><placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, I think, has never mustered so large a company since, for the duty was considered irksome and was evaded when possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234" />This company was succeeded by the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> Phalanx in <dateStruct value="1841--" full="yes" authname="1841"><year reg="1841" full="yes">1841</year></dateStruct>, which was dissolved in <dateStruct value="1849--" full="yes" authname="1849"><year reg="1849" full="yes">1849</year></dateStruct>, and was succeeded by the <rs>Lawrence</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="LightGuard">Light Guard</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1854--" full="yes" authname="1854"><year reg="1854" full="yes">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235" />This company was well organized and in a good state of discipline at the time of the breaking out of the war of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, in which, under its commander, <persName n="Hutchins,Captain,John,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01030" reg="default:Hutchins,John,,," authname="hutchins,john"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Hutchins</surname></persName>, it took an active part; but the period at which its brave and patriotic services were performed covers a later date than that assigned to me to record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236" />I can only say that their valor, their devotion, the patience and the courage with which they underwent the hardships and encountered the dangers of the war, were beyond all praise, and will ever be held in grateful remembrance by their townsmen and their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237" />I have spoken of <persName n="Brooks,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01031" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Alexander,Scammell,," authname="brooks,alexander,scammell"><roleName n="Governor" full="yes">Governor</roleName> <surname full="yes">Brooks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238" />It was once my good fortune to see him. In <dateStruct value="1819--" full="yes" authname="1819"><year reg="1819" full="yes">1819</year></dateStruct>, when he was governor and the district (now State) of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515" authname="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> was a part of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, he came down among us to attend, in his capacity of commander-in-chief, the annual militia musters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239" />My father then lived at <placeName key="tgn,7013556" n="1.000 9" reg="castine, hancock, maine" authname="tgn,7013556">Castine</placeName>, <pb id="p.86" n="86" /> and the muster-field was about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240" />He took me, then a lad of hardly <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, with him, and we walked to the muster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241" />He pointed out to me the governor as he galloped across the field at full speed—alone—to rectify some irregularity, upon a black horse, wearing a <num value="3">three</num>-cornered cocked hat, and a powdered cue hanging down his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242" />So much for the military history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243" />The next matter of special interest in the history of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the century relates to theological and parochial affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244" />All religious and parochial matters were the affair of the <rs>State</rs> and the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245" />Until <dateStruct value="1833--" full="yes" authname="1833"><year reg="1833" full="yes">1833</year></dateStruct> the law required every citizen to pay his portion of the expense of maintaining public worship according to his ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246" />So long as there was but <num value="1">one</num> religious society in the town, the town and the parish were <num value="1">one</num>—there was no distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247" />The town at its annual meetings voted the appropriations for the minister's salary and the other expenses for support of public worship, and every man was taxed for this purpose according to his means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248" />Religion was an affair of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249" />The prevailing doctrine of the churches was the old orthodox Calvinistic creed, but in the early part of the century, perhaps about <dateStruct value="1815--" full="yes" authname="1815"><year reg="1815" full="yes">1815</year></dateStruct>, this doctrine began to be held with a certain laxity of interpretation by many of the people and not a few of the ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250" />Those who wavered were frequently styled <hi rend="italics">Arminians</hi>, which seemed to indicate a rejection of the stricter doctrines of predestination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251" />The change was gradual, and at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> almost imperceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252" />Some of the older ministers were observed to dwell less in their sermons upon the <num value="5">five</num> points of Calvinism and more upon religion as a <hi rend="italics">life</hi> rather than a mode of belief, and a greater liberality of thought was allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253" />The stricter orthodox became uneasy, and in many of the older churches the division began.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254" /><persName n="Osgood,Doctor,David,,," id="n0334.0022.00086.01032" reg="default:Osgood,David,,," authname="osgood,david"><roleName n="Doctor" full="yes">Dr.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">David</foreName> <surname full="yes">Osgood</surname></persName> was settled in <dateStruct value="1774--" full="yes" authname="1774"><year reg="1774" full="yes">1774</year></dateStruct> over what was then the only church in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023" authname="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and continued to be <pb id="p.87" n="87" /> the pastor till his decease, in <dateStruct value="1822-12-" full="yes" authname="1822-12"><month reg="12" full="yes">December</month>, <year reg="1822" full="yes">1822</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255" />Undoubtedly, at the time of his settlement, his creed was what was then deemed strictly orthodox, and in a written statement containing his doctrinal views, on accepting the call, he acknowledged his belief <q direct="unspecified">in the doctrines specified in the assembly's catechism,</q> <q direct="unspecified">which doctrines,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">I am bound to profess, and as a preacher to teach and inculcate.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256" />The opposition to his settlement was very small, and seemed to come from those who were called <hi rend="italics">Arminians</hi>, and was founded upon his belief in those doctrines <q direct="unspecified">which,</q> said they in their written protest, <q direct="unspecified">represented an infinitely holy <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as the cause of all sin in his children.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257" />But his opposers soon became reconciled and gave him their hearty support, and during his life there was no interruption to the harmony of the church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258" />Yet but few reasoning, thinking men can maintain to old age either the philosophical or the theological opinions they held in youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259" />Though <persName n="Osgood,Doctor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00087.01033" reg="nearbymention:Osgood,David,,," authname="osgood,david"><roleName n="Doctor" full="yes">Dr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Osgood</surname></persName> never called himself a Unitarian, and never distinctly and publicly avowed a change in his belief, there can be no doubts, from many remarks dropped as if casually, and various little incidents which occurred, that for the latter part of his life the assembly's catechism ceased to be held in reverence, and that he was much more in accord with <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00087.01034" reg="mostcommon:Channing,nomatch:0" authname="channing"><roleName n="Doctor" full="yes">Dr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Channing</surname></persName> than with <persName n="Calvin,,John,,," id="n0334.0022.00087.01035" reg="default:Calvin,John,,," authname="calvin,john"><foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Calvin</surname></persName>.</p>
