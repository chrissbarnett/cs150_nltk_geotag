<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />The gulf stream of his life had not as yet flowed into the <rs>Arctic</rs> winter of age. His powers were unabated, his literary designs many, and his genial enthusiasms and high ambitions as warm as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" />So it is natural for the literary world, and for the <num value="1000">thousands</num> who had learned to await the appearance of his successive books, to feel sorrow at his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />But sorrow for the author by the world at large cannot approach the grief of his friends, who knew the man himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />But we who knew him by intimate contact seldom thought of him as an author at all. He had none of the affectations of authorship; he was utterly without lettered pride; he never <q direct="unspecified">talked like a book,</q> and he never posed like a celebrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />Success that makes small men vain never contracted the largeness of his heart or soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />His heart was like a wayside inn, where every traveler could rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70" />Those who knew the man could understand why his books found so many responsive readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />This popular conception of him is based on good reasons, but we should not be misled by it. His books are certainly books very popular with the young, but no man or woman is too old to find them readable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />He was wise enough to know that a healthy boy is a man in his hopes, and a good man is a boy in his memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />When he wrote a book the boy in his heart dictated to the man in his brain, and so the book was a book that either a man or boy would read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />He knew, what some writers of juveniles never learn, that a boy becomes wise very young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />So he knew better than to write patronizingly to his youthful readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" />He never stood on a high pedestal and shouted moral platitudes down to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" />He never told them to be good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" />He made them good, in the only way that a man or a boy can be made good, by making them think, good thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" />His fiction, in the highest sense of the word, is true; but his history is never fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />He took unusual pains to verify all historical statements and allusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />He was a voluminous writer, but he was not voluminous at the expense of accuracy and painstaking labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />But from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of my meeting with him I felt that I had known him for a long time, and we did not meet as strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />And now that he has gone from us, I think of him as of some comrade of many <pb id="p.1.16" n="16" /> years, and I am sure that I shall miss him quite as much as many of you whose privilege it has been to know him long before that privilege was mine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />I have seen <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0309.0001.00001.00079" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Elbridge,S.,," authname="brooks,elbridge,s."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Brooks</surname></persName> under varying conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" />I have been a guest in his home, and he has been a welcome guest in my own home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />I have seen him at his desk and in the social world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />I have seen him in health, and I have seen him when the precious heritage of health was no longer his. But I have never seen him when he was not brave, and cheery, and kindly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />He knew, as I knew, the last time I saw him, that the end was not far distant, but there was no complaint and no repining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" />I remember that when I said good-bye to him the last time I saw him, and I added that I hoped that he would feel better very soon, he smiled, but shook his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />A less courageous man, a man of less self-poise, and serenity, and sweetness of spirit, would have made some outcry against the cruel hand of fate that held the decree of death for him at a time when life seemed fullest of hopes and of harmonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />The memory of <persName n="Brooks,Mister,,,," id="n0309.0001.00001.00080" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Elbridge,S.,," authname="brooks,elbridge,s."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Brooks</surname></persName>' unfailing calmness and courage in those last days will give many of us more faith and more courage for our own battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />He seemed in his outward attitude to be verifying the words of <num value="1">one</num> of our modern poets, who has written that:â€” <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" />When he went out of this life, many a man lost a steadfast and <pb id="p.1.17" n="17" /> sympathetic friend, and the world of literature a potent power for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />The loss to those who were allied to him by ties of kinship and loved him best no man may measure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" />Interested in all that counts for anything in the uplifting of humanity, ready to give freely of his time, and glad to lend his influence to anything helpful in the town in which he lived, he attained to the high distinction of being a useful man in the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />That the community in which he lived appreciated his services and honored him is evidenced by this service to his memory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128" />His best self was not hidden.
